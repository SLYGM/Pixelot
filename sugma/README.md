# Pixelot UI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.0.

## Development server

Run `npm run nw` for a dev server.

## Code scaffolding

Run `npx ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist-ng/` directory.

Once built, run `npm run dist` to create distributable applications for each operating system, stored in the `dist/` directory.
Alternatively, run `npm run dist:windows` to only create windows binaries (faster). Same goes for Mac and Linux.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
